<html>The patriarch of the Zen lineage is Bodhidharma, a Buddhist monk who traveled from India in the 5th century AD to bring the practice of dhyana, or meditation, to China. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lineage became known as Ch'an, a word derived from dhyana. In the 12th century, the Tendai monk Eisai traveled to China to study Ch'an with the Lin-chi school -- Rinzai in Japanese -- and brought the teachings back to Japan.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobility continued to prefer the flowery Tendai rituals, however, and Zen, which is the Japanese pronunciation of Ch'an, did not become immediately popular. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dogen, another monk who traveled to China, helped establish Zen by founding the Soto school in the 13th century.
